                <p style="color:white;"> I am a multi-skilled freelancer with a passion for upscaling businesses through website design, store management, ads management across social media platforms, and customer service. With 1 year of experience as a Virtual Assistant for local and international businesses, I have honed my skills in Graphic Design, and SEO. I am a great team player, fast-working with a sense of precision and quality. I love challenges and can work under pressure.

                    I love to read books about psychology, science, and astronomy. I watch anime in my free time and cuddle with my dog named Sharpy. I play guitar and online games as well.
