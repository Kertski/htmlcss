            <h3>About Me</h3>
            
            <div>
                <p> I am a multi-skilled freelancer with a passion for upscaling businesses through website design, store management, ads management, and customer service. I have 1 year of experience as a Virtual Assistant for local and international businesses helping them strategize, boost their social media presence, upgrade their website, and boost their sales. I am a great team player, fast-working with a sense of precision and quality. I love challenges and can work under pressure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love to read books about psychology, science, and astronomy. In my free time, I watch anime, cuddle with my dog, play guitar and online games as well.
